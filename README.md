# ScriptsAssociatedWithLTPArticle
R scripts and data for LTP article: data clean-up & data analyses and visualizations.

Note: this is the part that follows after the mass spectrometry based lipid identification and filtering stage described in the lipyd repository.


## System informaton, and other context and instructions
These analysis has originally been performed with "R version 3.5.0" on a "x86_64-w64-mingw32" platform.

It has also been tested and the results have been double-checked with "R version 4.2.2" on a "x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)" platform.
No non-standard hardware is required to run the scripts in this specific repository.

It should be sufficient to have the R programming environment present on your system, and the following libraries should also be installed:
available from CRAN: stringr, RColorBrewer, circlize, beanplot; and available from Bioconductor: ComplexHeatmap.

The use of RStudio is advised but not absolutely necessary.
The installation of the R programming environment, potentially RStudio and the indicated libraries should be certainly possible in less than 1 hour on any common computer, but likely much faster.
