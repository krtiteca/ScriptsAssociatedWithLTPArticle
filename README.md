# ScriptsAssociatedWithLTPArticle
R scripts and data for LTP article: data clean-up & data analyses and visualizations.

Note: this is the part that follows after the mass spectrometry based lipid identification and filtering stage described in the lipyd repository.


## System information, and other context
These analysis has originally been performed with "R version 3.5.0" on a "x86_64-w64-mingw32" platform.

It has also been tested and the results have been double-checked with "R version 4.2.2" on a "x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)" platform.
No non-standard hardware is required to run the scripts in this specific repository.

It should be sufficient to have the R programming environment present on your system, and the following libraries should also be installed:
available from CRAN: stringr, RColorBrewer, circlize, beanplot; and available from Bioconductor: ComplexHeatmap.

The use of RStudio is advised but not absolutely necessary.
The installation of the R programming environment, potentially RStudio and the indicated libraries should be certainly possible in less than 1 hour on any common computer, but likely much faster.

These scripts should help you reproduce the articles and analyses of after the lipid identification and filtering stage for the article, as well as some intermediary figures not represented in the article, 
by following along with each step as described in the script. All necessary input files for these analyses are available in the associated InputData folder of this GitHub-repository, and the analysis should certainly be possible within 4 hours (or much faster) on any common computer, but will strongly depend on the available RAM.
